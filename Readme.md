# ZX80 4K BASIC Programs

A collection of programs for the ZX80 with the original 4K Integer BASIC ROM

# Macronics game conversions

These are versions of Macronics flicker-free ZX80 games to make them autostart and to patch the sync generation to use OUT $FF,A (like the ZX80 ROM) instead of OUT $FE,A (as originally). This will stop the speaker clicking when used with ZX80 BASIC on the Minstrel 4D, but will make no difference on a real ZX80 (or emulator).

Autostart uses the "nocash LD H,L trick" by Martin Korth
